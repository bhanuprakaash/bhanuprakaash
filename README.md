I'm a computer science graduate with expertise in software development. My skill set includes the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Spring, and MySql. I also did various projects that demonstrate my ability to build robust and efficient web applications.

I am passionate about open source and open to hear opportunities to contribute and learn.
